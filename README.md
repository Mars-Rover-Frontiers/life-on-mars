# Juno Project 4 - Life On Mars 


## Project Description

- Track down an API that is of interest of you and work through the documentation to see if the information you want is available.

- Be sure that the API DOES NOT require oAuth authentication. Requiring oAuth doesn't preclude you from using the API but it adds another layer of complexity to the project.


## Project objective

To show a understanding of jQuery, DOM manipulation, error handling, and UI design. And to demonstrate competence in pair programming and communication.

## Project Requirements

- It is clear to the user what the app does and results are displayed legibly
- Adds to the DOM dynamically using JavaScript
- App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop down menu, search field)
- App interacts with at least one API
- Code is organized using an object called "app" (i.e. it is namespaced)
- GitHub repo has more than one significant commit from each student
- App and interactions are accessible
- Site is live on GH Pages or student's own URL
- Errors are handled effectively
- Consistent class naming convention is used throughout
